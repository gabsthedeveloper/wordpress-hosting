# WordPress Hosting
## Overview
This project was created to automate the initial setup of a new website on my WordPress hosting platform. I used Ansible for this automation because it is an automation tool I have been wanting to use on a personal project. I used Ansible tasks, rather than roles, for better readability and because I do not see myself using this code outside of this project.
