# WordPress Hosting
## Overview
This project was created to automate the initial setup for new websites on my WordPress hosting platform. I used Ansible because it is an automation tool I have been wanting to use for a personal project. I used Ansible tasks, rather than roles, to keep the project concise and because I will only be using these tasks for this project.
